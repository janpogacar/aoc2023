# Advent of Code 2023
A repository containing code and data relating to the 2023 rendition of Advent of Code.

## About the code
Any code you find here was probably written in haste. It should not be considered optimized, neat,
or following any established programming practice. It shows *a way* of solving the given problem,
which at the time of writing, seemed the easiest to implement.

## Goals for this year
- Have fun and nothing else
